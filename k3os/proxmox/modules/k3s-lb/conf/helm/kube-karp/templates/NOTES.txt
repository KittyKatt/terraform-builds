1. You can check which host has the virtual IP by getting the interface configs via SSH on each node:

    ip addr show {{ .Values.envVars.interface }}

2. If you reboot/shut down the node that has the virtual IP, a different node should take over
  load balancing the incoming connections. For example, you can still access the kube api server at:

    https://{{ .Values.envVars.virtualIp }}:6443

3. For Kube API Server load balancing, do not forget to read the kube-karp project README on how to
  set up custom SANs in your API server cert! Otherwise, kubectl will not be able to connect
  without the insecure cert flag:

    kubectl --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true ...

  See the README for more info on how to fix this permanently:
